youtube-dl - download videos from youtube.com or other video platforms

# Sites

There're many sites with video contexts where youtube-dl can support.
However, youtube-dl do NOT supply sites **dedicated to copyright infringement**. As the result, the PR cannot be accepted.

The fork supports following:
- m4ufree
- xmovie8

Nowadays, m4ufree work accurately, but xmovie8 is still not working.
I welcome anyone to contribute just for researching purpose.
